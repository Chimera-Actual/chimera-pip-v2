# PostgreSQL & Extensions Upgrade Plan

## Current Status

### PostgreSQL Version
- **Current**: PostgreSQL 15.x (Supabase managed)
- **Target**: PostgreSQL 16.x or latest stable
- **Security Impact**: PostgreSQL 15.x has known security patches available

### Installed Extensions
- **PostGIS 3.3.x**: Geometry/geography support
- **vector**: Embedding support for AI operations
- **pg_stat_statements**: Query performance statistics

### Security Considerations

#### PostGIS Extensions in Public Schema
**Warning Level**: Medium
**Issue**: PostGIS extensions are installed in the public schema
**Impact**: Potential namespace pollution and privilege escalation risks
**Mitigation Applied**:
- Revoked CREATE permissions on public schema
- Explicit grants instead of blanket PUBLIC access
- Regular monitoring of extension permissions

#### Extension Security Recommendations
1. **Monitor Extension Updates**: Keep PostGIS and vector extensions updated
2. **Review Extension Permissions**: Regularly audit what permissions extensions have
3. **Schema Isolation**: Consider moving extensions to dedicated schema in future major upgrade

## Upgrade Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Upgrade Assessment (1-2 weeks)
1. **Compatibility Check**
   - Verify all application queries work with target PostgreSQL version
   - Test PostGIS extension compatibility with new PostgreSQL version
   - Validate vector extension compatibility
   - Check custom function compatibility

2. **Performance Baseline**
   - Capture current query performance metrics
   - Document current extension functionality
   - Export current database statistics

3. **Backup Strategy**
   - Full database backup before upgrade
   - Test backup restoration process
   - Document rollback procedures

### Phase 2: Staging Environment Testing (1 week)
1. **Create Staging Environment**
   - Mirror production database structure
   - Upgrade PostgreSQL version in staging
   - Test all application functionality
   - Validate extension behavior

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Compare query performance vs baseline
   - Test under load conditions
   - Validate geographic queries (PostGIS)
   - Test vector operations

### Phase 3: Production Upgrade (Maintenance Window)
**Estimated Downtime**: 2-4 hours

1. **Pre-Upgrade**
   - Final backup creation
   - Application maintenance mode
   - User notification

2. **Upgrade Process**
   - PostgreSQL version upgrade (Supabase managed)
   - Extension compatibility verification
   - Custom function recompilation if needed
   - Performance optimization

3. **Post-Upgrade Verification**
   - Application functionality testing
   - Database connectivity verification
   - Extension operation validation
   - Performance monitoring

4. **Rollback Plan**
   - If issues detected: restore from backup
   - Estimated rollback time: 1-2 hours
   - User communication procedures

### Phase 4: Post-Upgrade Monitoring (2 weeks)
1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Query performance comparison
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Extension functionality verification

2. **Security Verification**
   - Re-run security linter
   - Verify all RLS policies intact
   - Validate extension permissions

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss**: Mitigated by comprehensive backup strategy
- **Extended Downtime**: Mitigated by staging environment testing
- **Extension Incompatibility**: Mitigated by compatibility testing

### Medium Risk
- **Performance Regression**: Monitored and can be optimized post-upgrade
- **Feature Changes**: Documented and tested in staging

### Low Risk
- **Minor Configuration Changes**: Easily addressed
- **Documentation Updates**: Non-critical path

## Success Criteria

### Technical
- All application functionality working
- Query performance within 10% of baseline
- All extensions functioning correctly
- Security linter passes with no new critical issues

### Business
- User-facing functionality unchanged
- No data loss or corruption
- Planned downtime window respected

## Emergency Contacts

### Supabase Support
- Priority support ticket for upgrade issues
- Discord community for immediate help

### Internal Team
- Database administrator contact
- Application developer contact
- Security team contact

## Post-Upgrade Security Improvements

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Re-run security linter to verify no new issues
2. Update database security documentation
3. Verify all RLS policies functioning correctly

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Evaluate moving PostGIS to dedicated schema
2. Review and optimize extension permissions
3. Implement additional monitoring for new PostgreSQL features

### Long-term (Quarter 1)
1. Plan for next major PostgreSQL version
2. Evaluate new security features in upgraded version
3. Consider database-level security enhancements

## Documentation Updates Required

1. **Database Schema Documentation**: Update version references
2. **Security Procedures**: Update for new PostgreSQL version
3. **Backup/Recovery Procedures**: Verify and update
4. **Monitoring Dashboards**: Update version-specific metrics

## Budget Considerations

### Supabase
- Potential increased costs for newer PostgreSQL version
- Priority support costs during upgrade window

### Development Time
- Estimated 40-60 hours total team effort
- Testing and validation time
- Documentation updates

This upgrade plan ensures minimal risk while addressing the security patches available in newer PostgreSQL versions.
